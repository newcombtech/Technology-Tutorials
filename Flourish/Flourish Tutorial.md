**Flourish Tutorial**

1.  **Getting Data**

    -   Need to format Excel spreadsheet:
        <https://tulane.box.com/s/x2ceiafnh43axh5jf5fx4hlg4gdhgp8s>

    -   Upload data- must do it twice for each sheet. Remember to select
        Links (first excel sheet) or Points (second excel sheet) when
        uploading

    -   Links: Source to target connections (every link must be
        included)

    -   Points: ID= Display Name (only need one per name), Group is
        optional but is how points are different colors

2.  **Editing network**

    -   Switch to preview mode (top button) and use side bar to
        customize

    -   Points- change radius, label display settings

        -   Labels currently set to display point and neighbors on
            hover-- switch to All to have all labels displayed at once
            or Hover to just display singular point

    -   Color- change palette

    -   Links- edit links, add arrows

    -   Popups- enlarged box with display name on hover

    -   Layout- change font, margins

    -   Header- change title, subtitle, additional description text

    -   Footer- edit footer information

**Possible area of growth: Adding images**

To add image: add image column to Excel file (no data) and upload to
flourish, right click on box in Flourish and upload file, select image

Downside: with new data points, images all must be reuploaded through
Flourish (image links can't be saved in Excel file)
