**Setting up taxonomies for custom post types (like the custom book type
we made [[here]{.underline}](https://app.box.com/file/653156567297))**

1.  Open the CPT UI plugin and select the Add/Edit taxonomies sub
    > category

2.  Decide what your taxonomy will be. This is usually the broad
    > category and not the specific instance (for example the taxonomy
    > would be "genre" or "keyword" and not a specific genre like
    > poetry).

3.  Fill out the Taxonomy Slug (which will appear at the end of the URL
    > like
    > [www.bsb.com/books/genres]{.underline}[.](http://www.example.com/slug)
    > [genres]{.underline} is the slug in this example), plural label,
    > and singular label

4.  Make sure you attach the taxonomy to the custom post type that you
    > are working with (in this case it's the books custom post type).

5.  If you want to have access to a drop down menu of previously made
    > instances of the category, scroll down to settings and set
    > Hierarchical to true. If not, then there is no need to adjust the
    > settings.

> In this example, Genres is hierarchical, so a drop down menu of all
> established Genre and an option to add a new genre. Keywords is not
> hierarchical, so once you type in the first few letters of your
> search, previously entered keywords will come up as a suggestion, or
> you can enter a new one. Regions & Regionalism has been selected as
> the keywords. Authors is also not hierarchical and provides an example
> of what it looks like when authors\' names are suggested.

**Tagging custom posts**

1.  Make sure you're on the documents tab (not block)

2.  Select the genre from the drop down menu

3.  Type in the keyword (it should make a suggestion after a few
    > letters)

4.  Follow step two with author and state

5.  Don\'t forget to press update (blue button in the top right corner)
    > to make sure your tags

> save

\*Remember, there will be a drop down if the taxonomy is hierarchical
but you will have to type it manually if it is not. You can change these
settings by editing the taxonomy directly.
