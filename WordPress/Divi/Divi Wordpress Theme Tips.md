## Wordpress Tips

### Pages vs Post

*Pages for static pages, posts for articles*

-   I find it best to build all the pages that aren\'t articles (home
     page, about page, category landing pages, etc.) since pages since
     pages are designed for static content

-   I build all of the articles as posts, but you could also do them as
     pages. Posts are technically for if you are using wordpress as a
     blog, but you can turn off the date published.

### Divi

*Build all the pages using Divi*

-   [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/documentation/divi/)
     is a visual builder to create pages and posts by adding sections,
     rows, and modules

-   Sections can be used to group content into portions to distinguish
     it from other groups

-   Rows allow you to create columns within sections

-   Modules are the elements you can add like text, images, buttons,
     etc.

-   I usually start out building with Divi in the post editor, then I
     tweak it using the visual editor

-   Divi has great premade layouts that you can adapt for certain pages

-   Once you figure out a basic article page, you can clone the page and
     replace the filler content with the article content. You can also
     save certain blocks to be reused

### Settings Menu

*Divi settings vs Wordpress settings - generally, most things you want
to customize are in the Divi Themes Options*

-   **Appearance**

    -   Themes

        -   Keep this as Divi

    -   Customize

        -   *The set it and forget it settings. Create presets that will
             be the default for the whole website. You should set these
             first and then you won't really have to revisit them
             unless you want to change or tweak them.*

        -   Site title, tagline, and icon

        -   Theme accent color

        -   Fonts and link colors

        -   Footer credits

        -   Homepage settings (set to static home page not blog)

    -   Widgets

        -   I added an image widget to the footer that is the white
             newcomb logo on the gray background. The white footer I
             made with the Divi Theme Builder

    -   Menu

        -   Add pages to the menu

        -   Organize the hierarchy of pages

        -   Can add a menu item that is a page/post or a custom link
             (how I linked to the Newcomb page)



-   **Divi**

    -   Theme Options

        -   General

            -   Change logo

            -   Grab the first post image (disable)

            -   Social media profiles

            -   Custom CSS

        -   Navigation

            -   Exclude pages/categories from navigation bar

        -   Layout

            -   Choose which items to display in the post info section

                -   I only have categories turned on

                -   Turning on on author/date won't let you add a custom
                     author or data, it will just show the account you
                     signed in with and the date you published the
                     article

            -   Show comments on posts/pages (I disabled, but you could enable if you want people to be able to comment)

            -   Place Thumbs on Posts/Pages (disable)

    -   Theme Builder

        -   Set global or custom headers and footers

            -   This is how I made the white footer that is on the
                 bottom of all of the articles

    -   Theme Customizer

        -   Takes you to the wordpress customize settings (same as
             appearance â†’ customize)
