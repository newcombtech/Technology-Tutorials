Embedding maps on your website is actually super easy! You can put a
map on your website with Google's My Maps tool. The first step is to
create your personalized map, on
[www.google.com/map](http://www.google.com/map) and
 select +CREATE A NEW MAP. Then, you'll want to add points to your map.

 The video here shows a basic demonstration of adding a marker to the
 map, including multiple images and videos.

## Generating HTML

 Once your map is made, you can add it to your website with a custom
 HTML element. Google will generate this HTML element for you, as I've
 shown in the video below. Once you have the HTML element, you can
 simply put this directly onto WordPress.

 Sample code is shown here, but you won't need to generate this
 yourself. Feel free to try:
