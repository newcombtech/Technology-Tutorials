# Tableau Graphical Data Representation for MCH

Compiled by DRI Marisa Long

1.  Download these four files/folders from box and place somewhere
    convenient.

    They can be found here: <https://app.box.com/folder/133174409935>

2.  Open Tableau Public on your desktop. You may need to login using the
    Tulane credentials, which are:

    Username: ncitech@wave.tulane.edu

    Password: Newcomb12!

    Or if you are working on a personal project, create your own login with
    Tableau Public.

    To start a new viz, you'll need to open either one of the geospatial
    files or the excel sheets. Click on the appropriate one and then select
    one of these files that you just downloaded. Click open.

3.  Tableau will take you to the data source page. Add all the other
    data sources you just downloaded by clicking on the "Add" button by
    "Connections." Once all four are added, click the "New Sheet"
    button.

4.  Next, you going to begin moving over data over to form our
    visualizations. For this tutorial, I'm going to explain using the
    data from "Birth outcomes by year" in "House districts" but this
    could be done with the parish or senate data as well.

5.  To create a pie graph, you're going to move the names of the
    districts (here represented by Nameslad) to either the rows or
    columns.

Then, drag race over under marks and drop it on top of the square labeled "colors."

Next, drag the information that you want to be represented in the pie graph over under marks to the "size" box.

Next, under marks, click on the single select and change it to pie.

We want to get rid of the "total" category, so right click on race and select filter. Then, unselect "total" or any other data you don't want to appear in your pie chart.

Here is the result:

6.  For the bar graphs, drag the names (namelsad) into the columns box
    and number of births (nbirth) into the rows.

To separate by race again, drag rage under marks on top of the box "color." Use the same steps above to get rid of the total category by right clicking on race, going to filter, and deselecting "total."

Drag over other data you would like to display into rows. Here, I moved over Nlbw and Nptb.

Put them side-by-side by clicking on the "Show me" button in the upper-right-hand corner and selecting the side-by-side bars. You may have to re-drag race to color.

7.  For the line and area graphs, once again drag the names (namelsad)
    into the columns box and number of births (nbirth) into the rows.

Also drag race over color and remove the total from the filter.

Then, change this to an area graph or line graph by going to the
single-select drop down under marks and changing it to be "area" or
"line."
